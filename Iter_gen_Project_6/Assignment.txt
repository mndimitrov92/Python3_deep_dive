The goal of this project is to rewrite the pull pipeline we created in the Application - Pipelines - Pulling video in the Generators as Coroutines section.
You should look at the techniques we used in the Application - Pipelines - Broadcasting video and apply them here.
The goal is to write a pipeline that will push data from the source file, cars.csv, and push it through some filters and a save coroutine to ultimately save the results as a csv file.
Try to make your code as generic as possible, and don't worry about column headers in the output file (unless you really want to!).
When you are done with your solution you should be able to specify an arbitrary number of filters on the name field.
If you specify Chevrolet, Carlo and Landau for three filters, your output file should contain two lines of data only:
Chevrolet Monte Carlo Landau,15.5,8,350.0,170.0,4165.,11.4,77,US
Chevrolet Monte Carlo Landau,19.2,8,305.0,145.0,3425.,13.2,78,US
